I live in Llantalbot and I'm a teaching assistant. 

I have a 5-year record of standing up for Llantalbot residents, from supporting them in council meetings to helping to establish Llantalbot Community Aid during the first lockdown.

You’ve probably seen my name on a ballot paper before, that’s because I am a local person who is passionate about changing our community for the better. 

I am the only candidate in this election standing on a clear policy platform, that presents a clear plan for the future of Llantalbot.

It's clear that our current people infrastructure isn't working for the county. Our schools are oversubscribed, and some of our most vital public services need more investment. 

It's why the Purple Party want to build a brand new school, improve the library services across the county, and refurbish the old Llantalbot Community Centre, which has been neglected for years and is no longer fit for purpose.

If elected I will be available to Llantalbot residents through regular surgeries held at the Purple Party office in town. I will also offer a pop-up version of this where if you have a local issue on your road, I will come to you to speak with you and your neighbours so we can work together to get it solved. I won’t pass the buck and I will do everything I can to build the better future Llantalbot deserves.
