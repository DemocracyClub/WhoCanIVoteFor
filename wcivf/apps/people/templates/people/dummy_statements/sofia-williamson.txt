I decided to stand as a candidate in this year's election because I'm sick and tired of the mess in our local area. As a resident of Llantalbot for 45 years, I've seen that this is an issue that the council has completely failed to tackle. There is a long-standing litter issue on St.Alban's Road which backs on to Llantalbot park. Incredibly, despite the long-standing nature of the issue there is a distinct lack of bins on this road, and no warning signs of fines to deter those responsible. On top of this, just a few streets away on Ffordd Dderw, the situation with dog mess is unacceptable. We need tough fines for those people who do not clean up after their dogs, and more bins to make it easy for people to dispose of the mess. Llantalbot deserves better.
