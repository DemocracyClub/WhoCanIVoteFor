Wales is a great nation with so many incredibly talented people who, in the main, want to work together on issues which affect us all.

I joined the Lilac Party because of its desire to help local economies. As a small business owner this is something I'm passionate about. Covid has wreaked havoc on local businesses with many having to close, and others just doing enough to keep their heads above water. Going forward, we need to do as much as possible to get people out in Llantalbot and spending money in local shops. 

Initiatives like free buses on the weekend should be looked at to get more people into our lifeless town centre. We should also be considering steps like free parking in some of the council's car parks, to further encourage people into the town centre. 

In terms of our general county infrastructure, it's also clear that we need a new bypass road to help with the huge traffic issues we currently have in Llantalbot. There is lots of unused land that could be utilised for this, helping to harness Llantalbot's full economic potential.
