I am a qualified doctor and a  volunteer with Llantalbot Good Neighbours. I am a founder and trustee of Llantalbot Pride. I chose to settle in Llantalbot because I loved the town for its warm feel. I felt part of community. I have believed in my town and proud to be in Llantalbot.

One issue close to my heart is Llantalbot park. I love this park - it's where I used to take my children when they were young. But over recent years it's been plagued by vandalism. If you choose me to represent you, I'll make sure that the concerns about the park are heard. It needs a bit of love and care, including new fences, new play equipment, and the gates to be opened and locked in the mornings and evenings, just like many other parks have across the county. I woud also love to see more cycle paths to help our town get healthier and more eco-friendly.
