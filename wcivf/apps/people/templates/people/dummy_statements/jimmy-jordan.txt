The yellow party's manifesto is dedicated to making our whole county greener, cleaner, and better.

Top of the list is a new network of cycle paths, including a new three-mile path surrounding the town centre. This will mean fewer cars on the road, cleaner air for us all, and a happier and healthier Llantalbot. 

We also want to see an overhaul in recycling. Over the past four years, the county's recycling percentages have stayed the same, and we need to do more. We want to change the way household waste is collected, so that non-recyclable waste is collected once a month, as opposed to every two weeks. This will encourage more people to recycle a greater portion of their waste, and hopefully making our county the best recycling county in Wales. 

Another issue we're passionate about is housing. We need new, high-quality, modern housing to meet demand. On the old Llantalbot factory site, we want to give permission to build 60 new homes, all fitted with heat pumps instead of gas boilers, to help with our climate crisis, and to make sure more people have good housing available to them.
