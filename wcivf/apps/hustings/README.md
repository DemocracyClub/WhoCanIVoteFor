A husting originally referred to a native Germanic governing assembly, the thing.

By metonymy, the term may now refer to any event, such as debates or speeches,
during an election campaign where one or more of the representative candidates are present.
The term is used synonymously with stump in the United States.

**Or so says [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Husting)**
