            <h2>First-past-the-post (FPTP)</h2>
            <p>The First-past-the-post voting system
                is the simplest of all the voting
                systems used in UK elections. Simply put:
                each voter has a single vote, and the
                candidate with the most votes wins the seat.
                It is used in UK Parliament elections and for
                English and Welsh local government elections.
            </p>

            <h3>Block vote</h3>
            <p>The only variation of this voting system is
                known as the Block Vote. Some local government
                seats are multi-member, meaning, for example,
                that they may return three councillors to represent
                one ward. In this instance, the voter will get three
                votes. This is sometimes called a block vote.
                Voters do not have to vote for candidates from the
                same party, however.
            </p>

            <h3>Example election</h3>
            <p>Taking an example ward from the 2019 local elections
                in Lincolnshire, you can see that the independent
                candidate was the most popular and so was elected,
                but only two of the three Conservatives were. If the
                Conservative vote had been split more evenly between
                their candidates, then they may have allowed the sole
                Labour candidate to get elected. Parties and voters,
                therefore, have to take an educated guess at how well
                they may do in this sort of election. Parties may wish
                to indicate who their lead candidates are to voters.
