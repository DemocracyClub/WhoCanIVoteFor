                <h2>The Additional Member System</h2>
                <p>The Additional Member System is a form of proportional representation.
                    AMS is used for elections to the Scottish and Welsh Parliaments,
                    as well as for those to the London Assembly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Voters get two ballot papers and may vote on both: one for their
                    constituency representative, elected on the <a href="{% url 'fptp_voting_system_view' %}">First-past-the-post</a>
                    method, and one for a regional representative. They don’t have to
                    vote for the same party on both ballots.

                    For example, a voter in Paisley in Scotland will receive a ballot
                    that lists all of the candidates wanting to represent Paisley in
                    the Scottish Parliament. They will also receive a ballot that
                    lists the parties and/or independent candidates contesting the
                    seven seats for West Scotland. The candidates on the regional
                    ballot paper are ranked by the political party in the order they
                    want them elected, and voters get no choice over this order
                    (this is known as a 'closed list').

                <h3>Seat allocation</h3>
                <p>The overall number of constituency seats that a party wins will have
                    an effect on how many regional representatives it is allocated.
                    This is designed to bring a party's number of seats closer to the
                    percentage of the overall vote it received in a region.
                    Regional seats are allocated according to a formula known as the D’Hondt
                    method. The number of votes needed to win a seat (the ‘quota’) is
                    calculated using the following formula:
                    <p class="ds-card ds-padded ds-dark">
                        Vote quota = Total number of votes won by the party / Total number of seats already won by the
                        party, +1.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Seats are allocated after rounds of counting. In order to be
                        allocated a regional seat, a party must have the highest vote number
                        after the above formula has been applied.

                    Although the SNP won the most votes,
                    because they won eight out of the ten
                    constituency seats their quota was 15,092,
                    below almost all the other parties.
                    As a result, they were not entitled to
                    any regional seats.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Labour and the Conservatives also each
                    won a constituency seat, so their vote
                    tally is divided by two in round one of
                    the seat allocation, while everyone else’s
                    is divided by one. Labour’s vote quota in
                    round one was 36,272 (72,544/2) so the
                    top-ranked person on their list was elected.
                </p>
                <p> This process was then repeated, with
                    Labour’s vote total now 24,181 as it was
                    divided by three. The Conservatives,
                    therefore, took the second list seat.
                    This process went on until the seventh
                    seat was won by the Green party, who
                    had 17,218 votes to the SNP’s quota of
                    15,091.
