    <p>In most cases you will need to visit your polling station in order to vote.</p>

    <p>Your polling station is <strong>{{ polling_station.polling_station.address }}</strong></p>

    <p>You should get a "poll card" through the post telling you where to vote.</p>
    <p>If you haven't got one, or aren't sure where to vote, you should call
      {{ polling_station.council.name }} on <a href="tel:{{ polling_station.council.phone }}">
        {{ polling_station.council.phone }}</a></p>
