            <h2>Supplementary Vote</h2>
            <p>The Supplementary Vote electoral system allows voters
                to cast a first and second preference vote on one
                ballot. If no candidate gains at least half of all first
                preference votes, then the two leading candidates go into a run-off round and all other candidates are eliminated.
                The second preference votes on the eliminated candidates' ballots are then counted and added to the leading candidates' totals.

                This is designed to ensure that the elected candidate
                has closer to majority support than would be the case
                under <a href="{% url 'fptp_voting_system_view' %}">First-past-the-post</a>.

                Voters do not need to cast a second preference vote, and cannot vote for the same candidate twice.

                SV is used for Police and Crime Commissioner elections
                in England and Wales, and for the positions of directly-elected
                mayors in England, including London, Manchester, and Liverpool.
            </p>
            <h3>Example election</h3>
            <p>
                Taking the results of the 2016 Police and Crime Commissioner
                election in Nottinghamshire, the Labour candidate won less
                than 50% of the first preference vote, so a second round was
                needed. The second preference votes from the eliminated
                independent and UKIP candidates were counted, and were awarded
                to either Labour or Conservatives.
            </p>

            <p>
                As you can see, of the 41,773 votes cast for the three eliminated
                candidates, only 16,773 cast second preference votes for
                either Labour of Conservative. Some voters may have decided
                not to cast a second preference vote, or may have voted for
                one of the other eliminated candidates as a second preference.
