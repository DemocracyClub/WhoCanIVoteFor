    <h1>UK Prospective Parliamentary&nbsp;Candidates</h1>

    <p>The next UK parliamentary general election is due to occur no later than January 2025, and political parties are
        currently selecting their candidates for each House of Commons constituency.</p>

    <p>Democracy Club’s volunteers are collecting information on each candidate as they are announced. The live tables
        below display all the candidates we are aware of. Where a candidate has a recent electoral history, this is
        displayed on their Democracy Club profile.</p>
