## About

This site was developed by [Democracy Club](https://democracyclub.org.uk), specifically
[Sym Roe](https://twitter.com/symroe), [Joe Mitchell](https://twitter.com/j0e_m)
and [Tim Green](https://twitter.com/tfgg2).  This site would not be possible without the help
of 100s of contributors to [Democracy Club Candidates](https://candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/), and in turn the
support of [mySociety](https://www.mysociety.org/)

The data on candidates from the UK general election in 2010 is all taken
from Edmund von der Burg's YourNextMP.com, with many thanks.

You can use the data from this site, via the [Democracy Club Candidates](https://candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/)
API or CSV download, under the
terms of the Creative Commons license Attribution-ShareAlike (CC-BY-SA) with
the exception of:

The party logos, which are taken from the Electoral Commission's website
Candidate photos, which are typically either submitted by the candidates
themselves, or from sources where it seems reasonable that we might use them
on this site, such as the party's official page for that candidate, or their
social media profile picture.

If the CC-BY-SA licence is problematic for you,
but you feel that you have a worthwhile use of the data in mind, please
contact us to discuss your situation further.

For complicated reasons relating to database licensing, we have put the data
as of the 4th of March 2015 into the public domain by declaring it to be CC0.
This data is available here but please be warned that this snapshot will
become inaccurate very quickly - please use the up-to-date data instead.

The source code for this site is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/DemocracyClub/WhoCanIVoteFor),
and you can find [a list of known bugs](https://github.com/DemocracyClub/WhoCanIVoteFor/issues) there as well.
